"Developed a dynamic Power BI dashboard for healthcare analysis, focusing on conditions like obesity, diabetes, cancer, and hypertension.
The dashboard integrates data on hospitals, doctors, and medical assistance types (emergency and non-emergency). 
Advanced features such as filters, bookmarks, and tooltips were employed to enhance user interaction, enabling in-depth exploration and providing tailored insights into healthcare trends across different regions."
